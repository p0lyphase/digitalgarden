## Co-ops Under Capitalism

>[!NOTE] Utopian
>Co-ops are another wave of utopian socialism akin to what was seen during the Industrial Revolution. 
>#### Robert Owens
>1771 - 1858
>English Utopian Socialist

>[!NOTE] Misdirection
>While co-ops speak to the workplace and the relative lack of power over day to day decisions, it doesn't speak to the governmental task of removal of existing industrial capitalist property from private hands to Commons property, and the suppression of the former ruling class from regaining power over production again.
