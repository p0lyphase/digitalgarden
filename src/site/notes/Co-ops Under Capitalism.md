## Co-ops Under Capitalism

>[!NOTE] Utopian
>Co-ops are another wave of utopian socialism akin to what was seen during the Industrial Revolution. 
>#### Robert Owens
>1771 - 1858
>English Utopian Socialist

>[!NOTE] Misdirection
>While co-ops speak to the workplace and the relative lack of power over day to day decisions, it doesn't speak to the governmental task of removal of existing industrial capitalist property from private hands to Commons property, and the suppression of the former ruling class from regaining power over production again.

>"... so long as the other classes, especially the capitalist class, still exists, so long as the proletariat struggles with it (for when it attains government power its enemies and the old organization of society have not yet vanished), it must employ _forcible_ means, hence governmental means. It is itself still a class and the economic conditions from which the class struggle and the existence of classes derive have still not disappeared and must forcibly be either removed out of the way or transformed, this transformation process being forcibly hastened."
>- Karl Marx, "Conspectus of Bakuninâ€™s  _Statism and Anarchy_" [Found here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1874/04/bakunin-notes.htm)
