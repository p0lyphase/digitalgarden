## Co-ops Under Capitalism

>[!NOTE] Utopian
>Co-ops are another wave of utopian socialism akin to what was seen during the Industrial Revolution. 
>#### Robert Owens
>1771 - 1858
>English Utopian Socialist

>[!NOTE] Misdirection
>While co-ops speak to the workplace and the relative lack of power over day-to-day decisions, it doesn't speak to the governmental task of removal of existing industrial capitalist property from private hands to Commons property, and the suppression of the former ruling class from regaining power over production again.

>"... so long as the other classes, especially the capitalist class, still exists, so long as the proletariat struggles with it (for when it attains government power its enemies and the old organization of society have not yet vanished), it must employ _forcible_ means, hence governmental means. It is itself still a class and the economic conditions from which the class struggle and the existence of classes derive have still not disappeared and must forcibly be either removed out of the way or transformed, this transformation process being forcibly hastened."
>
>- Karl Marx, "Conspectus of Bakunin’s  _Statism and Anarchy_" [Found here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1874/04/bakunin-notes.htm)

>[!NOTE] Seeds are a start
>Seeds are an initial germination of information that may then develop and bear fruit, but it is important that social acts are reproducible.


>"... like slave labour, like serf labour, hired labour is but a transitory and inferior form, destined to disappear before associated labour plying its toil with a willing hand, a ready mind, and a joyous heart. In England, the seeds of the cooperative system were sown by _Robert Owen;_ the same working men’s experiments, tried on the Continent, were, in fact, the practical upshot of the theories, not invented, but loudly proclaimed, in 1848."

>[!NOTE] Co-ops are still important
>While co-ops are not the mechanism for revolutionary change, they are an important mechanism of working class ingenuity and experimentation. 



### Notes

On the subject of Utopianism, the reach for co-operatives is well-meaning but ultimately not up to the task of revolution in the sense of its class-meaning, i.e. one class against another. It seeks a "dual power" system as an interim not marked by antagonism, but rather, a kind of integration alongside the capitalist class. There's power to share.

On the matter of misdirection, based upon the above lack of antagonism, it avoids the central question of domination of capitalists as a class over the class of workers. There remains the fact that the government apparatus is wielded by the class in power, and it is a goal for the working class to not just achieve economic power, but political power as well.

This would include the actual apparatus of government and its functions.
