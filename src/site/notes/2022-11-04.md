Watching a Spanish video about Simondon, "[forma y energia 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnLFdg3SLXY)" that has good info on differential equations and integration.

>Dynamical systems involve a *state space,* an abstract __mathematical space__ of points where each point represents a possible state of the system.

>A dynamical system is described by one or more *differential equations* that specify its *behavior over short time windows*. To determine the system's behavior for a longer period, it is necessary to *integrate the equations*, either analytically or through iteration.

I am reminded of determinism and an argument I hear that, "if we could return to the original set of conditions it would play out the same" which, to me, sounds like an non-falsifiable claim. You can never return to the initial conditions, and we can't know if it would "play out the same."
