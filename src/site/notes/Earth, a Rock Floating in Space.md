I imagine the earth as a rock floating through space. It is a largely enclosed system, and it'd go cold on its own, so good thing there's a star nearby that gives it a constant shower of energy. The earth receiving this energy has to dispense of it, moving its way towards equilibrium. The materials on the earth's surface groove to the cycles of rotation and the cycles of revolution as it disperses this energy, forming new cycles with completely different grooves along the way.

The universe is so bountiful in potential but sometimes two people passing in the hallway never stop to interact. When there's an interaction, though, suddenly the possibilities explode in all directions based on all sorts of ways of dividing up and permeating through all possible scenarios throughout all time. Soon as you zero in on a specific interaction you suddenly find a specific unfolding, a story, a narrative, a life.

The materials on the surface of the earth are energized and bumping, moving, heaving, breathing, loving, all in tandem, all at once. There's no ending to me and no beginning to you, just one continuous surface and movement, endlessly folding and unfolding. There is no distinction between life and non-life. There is no distinction between human and nature.

When the potential energy of the universe channels into an actuality it meets resistance, breakdown, trauma, connection, joy, solidarity, despair, homogenization, and differentiation, but these require interaction. Interactions come with structure through which energies must both animate and also break down. The act of doing is also the act of undoing. These aren't dualities, but instead these are one in the same process.

If I take materialist monism (as I understand it) to its end then my perspective must shift away from my own view being centered, or even the human view being centered, and I must reorient my conceptions so that the very clay of the earth dances and moves. What we call life is just matter, coalesced from the materials around it, that manifests in a very dynamic manner. There's no need for any essence or vitalism.
