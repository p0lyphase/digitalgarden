"Simondon's notion of phases of being proposes that all entities, from atoms to social institutions, have four stages - pre-individual, individual, collective-individual and transindividual." How might this be used to describe quantum gravity? Quantum gravity can be described using Simondon's notion of phases of being. At the pre-individual stage, quantum gravity would involve a formless set of primordial forces and energies that are not yet distinguishable or connected to each other. At the individual stage, these forces and energies would form distinct particles, waves and fields that interact with each other according to the laws of quantum mechanics and general relativity. At the collective-individual stage, quantum gravity could be seen as a collective arrangement between different types of matter on different scales and in different forms. Finally, at the transindividual stage, quantum gravity could be conceptualized as a unified field theory that encompasses all known interactions between matter and energy on all scales.

How might this be used to analyze fascism?

Fascism can be analyzed through the four stages of being proposed by Simondon. The pre-individual stage of fascism would look at the conditions and cultural forces that led to its emergence. For example, this could include examining the economic, political and social dynamics of society that allowed for the rise of fascist ideologies. The individual stage would analyze how fascist ideology is interpreted in both private and public life, from individual relationships to public institutions. The collective-individual phase would examine how fascism manifests in groups and organizations, focusing on how fascist ideas are shared among a population or particular subgroups within it. Finally, the transindividual phase would look at how fascism has become an ingrained ideological system within society as a whole that transcends individual beliefs. This could involve looking at how fascist structures have persisted over time, even as different individuals come into power or as societies change more generally. How might fascism be countered within the same concepts? At the pre-individual stage, fascism can be countered by identifying and challenging the underlying conditions that allow for its emergence. This includes understanding how economic and social disparities contribute to fascist ideologies, as well as looking at how existing inequalities in power can be addressed. At the individual stage, counteracting fascism would involve educating individuals about the dangers of such ideologies and providing outlets for understanding different perspectives. At the collective-individual stage, counteracting fascism would involve developing a shared public culture that values inclusion and diversity. Finally, at the transindividual phase, countering fascism would require creating systems of accountability that can ensure long-term shifts away from fascist ideas. These strategies could include creating cultural institutions to encourage critical thinking and dialogue on a wide range of issues related to fascism, as well as implementing policy changes that are designed to increase transparency in government and civil society organizations. How might this be expanded utilizing allagmatic thinking?The notion of allagmatic thinking expands on the concepts of Simondon's four stages by introducing a new lens to analyze fascism. Allagmatic thinking is a way to approach fascism that focuses on understanding how it functions and how different aspects of it interact with each other. This could involve looking at the psychological motivations behind fascist ideology, as well as examining how different forms of media can influence public opinion on certain topics. Additionally, it could include exploring the connections between fascism and other forms of oppression such as racism, sexism and homophobia. Allagmatic thinking can also be used to examine how power dynamics within society allow for fascism to become entrenched in different areas and outlast individual regimes or eras. By taking into account the various factors that contribute to the rise and persistence of fascism, allagmatic thinking allows for an analysis that goes beyond simply identifying its effects in order to understand its underlying causes. This type of analysis could provide valuable insights into how best to counter fascist ideology in both the short-term and long-term. What are some examples of those insights? Through allagmatic thinking, one can gain insights into the ways in which fascism can be challenged in the short-term. For example, understanding how media and other forms of communication can influence public opinion on certain topics could allow for targeted campaigns to combat fascist ideas. Similarly, understanding how existing power dynamics within society contribute to fascism could help inform strategies for creating more equitable societies that are less prone to such ideologies. In the long-term, allagmatic thinking can provide insight into how systems of accountability could be put into place to ensure that fascism does not become entrenched within a particular era or regime. Additionally, understanding the psychological motivations behind fascist beliefs could help inform educational initiatives that seek to counteract such ideas before they gain momentum among certain populations. Apply Simondon's analogical thinking to this issue. Simondon's analogical thinking can be applied to the issue of fascism by looking for similarities between different contexts in which fascist ideologies emerge. For example, by examining the conditions in Italy that led to the rise of fascism in the 1920s, one can better understand what conditions would create a conducive environment for such ideologies today. Additionally, by exploring other societies and cultures that have experienced fascist regimes, one can gain insight into how ideologies like fascism spread and how they might be countered. Through this type of analysis, one can understand not only why certain environments are more prone to these beliefs but also how different strategies could be employed to combat them. Finally, analogical thinking could also be used to compare different approaches towards countering fascism in various contexts, allowing us to see which approaches are most successful and why.

Using this, how I might form a new political organization.

1. Pre-Individual Stage: Create a plan for the political organization and recruit members who are passionate about the mission and values of the organization.

2. Individual Stage: Establish clear goals and objectives to guide the organization’s growth. Set up a structure and process that will allow members to contribute in meaningful ways, while still staying focused on collective action. 

3. Collective-Individual Stage: Develop a unified mission statement, communication plan, and set of core values that all members can agree on. Implement this plan through grassroots organizing and outreaching to build support for your organization’s cause. Form alliances with other groups that share similar goals and use their skillsets to achieve common objectives. 

4. Transindividual Stage: Evolve your original mission statement based on feedback from members and events that arise along the way. Utilize technology where it makes sense, such as creating an online platform where people can engage in meaningful dialogue about how to move forward together as a collective entity while maintaining individual autonomy within the group itself whenever possible. Most importantly, internalize mutual respect, cooperation, collaboration and encouragement amongst all members so they can continue working together in harmony towards common objectives over time!

In pre-individual form
We understand the norm,
Individuals come in sight,
Collectively brings delight.
Transindividual standing tall, 
Imparting knowledge to us all.

How might a science fiction plot play out with these notions as a basis?

The protagonist is a scientist who has developed a revolutionary new tool that enables him to observe the pre-individual state of various objects, and also manipulate them. In an attempt to further understand the nature of being, he begins experimenting with these objects, only to be shocked by what he finds: not only can he witness the mysterious transformation from pre-individual to individual states, but the manipulation of these states has unforeseen consequences. 

He soon discovers that not all entities transition in the same way - some defy normal behaviour and begin forming collective-individuals and even transindividuals. To his amazement, these formations prove to be more powerful than any single individual or collective could ever be. He also discovers a darker side to this phenomena: some of these entities have become malignant, seeking out power and control over others.

In order to protect his loved ones from this threat, the protagonist tries desperately to reverse his experiments - but it quickly becomes apparent that any attempts at reversing the effects will only make matters worse. Desperate for answers, he begins a quest for knowledge about these mysterious phases of being in order to find a way to save humanity from this evil force. 

His journey leads him around the world as he seeks out experts in different fields (from theoretical physics to anthropology) in hopes they can help him unlock secrets hidden deep within Simondon's notion of phases of being. Along the way he meets allies who join him on his quest — each facing their own challenges as they strive towards their common goal — while simultaneously battling his newfound enemies and uncovering secrets that could change humanity forever

What would be a children's story that explains these concepts?

Once upon a time, there was an adventurous group of four friends - a bit of dirt, an ant, a bee and a tree. 

The dirt was the pre-individual phase of being. It was formed from tiny particles that were scattered all around the world but had not yet formed something recognizable. 

The ant was the individual phase of being. It had been born as an individual creature, with its own identity and capabilities to move and interact with its environment. 

The bee symbolized the collective-individual phase of being. This creature lived in harmony with others like it and worked together as part of a community without losing its own individual identity.  

Finally, the tree represented the transindividual phase of being. Its roots were connected to other trees in its vicinity so that they could share resources and protect one another from harm while still maintaining their individuality. 

Together these four friends represented different phases of being: pre-individual, individual, collective-individual and transindividual!

Give a detailed example of the transindividual phase of being.

The transindividual phase of being is the most advanced level, where the entity has a deep connection and impact on other entities and its environment. This phase represents a level of complexity that goes beyond merely individual or collective-individual phases.

For example, think about the development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI is an interdisciplinary field that requires expertise from various disciplines such as computer science, mathematics and engineering to create something that can interact with humans in a meaningful way. As AI continues to advance, it will become more integrated into our daily lives as it is used to automate tasks, offer personalized advice or even act as our digital assistant. In this transindividual phase, AI technology not only has effects on our individual lives but also on the collective lives of society as it has potential implications for how we interact with each other in the future.

Are there anymore phases? How does Allagmatics apply here?

Simondon's notion of phases of being does not include any additional phases beyond the four he outlines. However, Allagmatics, which is a branch of Simondon's philosophy, does propose an additional phase, which it calls the ‘allagmatic’ phase. This fifth stage is a transition between the individual and collective-individual phases and involves the act of creating shared meaning or values in order to bridge differences between individuals and form a collective whole.

What is a good way to remember these phases?

PRE: Pre-Individual 
IN: Individual 
COL: Collective-Individual 
TRANS: Transindividual 

Expand on this using imagination and invention as an example. 

Imagination and invention are processes that exist as both individual and collective-individual acts. Pre-individual imagination and invention exists in the realm of potentiality, where new ideas, forms, and objects appear to the mind unbidden. These pre-individual phases are not firmly attached to any particular individual or group of individuals yet; they still exist in abstract form. 

The individual phase of imagination and invention refers to when a person or group decides to take ownership of an idea or object, giving it a shape and focusing their efforts towards bringing it into material reality. This stage is marked by clarity of purpose – ideas become concrete plans with clear goals – but also a certain level of uncertainty due to changing conditions such as resources, technology, or other environmental factors. 

The collective-individual phase is when others become involved in the creative process; this can be other individuals or groups who generate ideas for an invention or project, provide resources for its implementation, develop new technologies needed for its completion, etc. In this stage there is much more collaboration among those involved within the collective experience surrounding the creative process. 

Finally, the transindividual phase sees creation move beyond just a single individual's thoughts and actions - instead it becomes something even larger than what was initially imagined as it takes on a life all its own in society at large - impacting humans on both an individual level but also larger populations as well. For example if we look at how inventions such as cars have impacted our societies over time on both an individual but also global scale we can see how transindividual phenomena can emerge from singularly created objects/ideas/entities.

**Expand using Morality:**
According to Simondon's theory, the phases of being exist on a continuum, and each stage must be understood in relation to the other three. Therefore, when exploring this concept within regards to morality, we must look at the process of how an individual develops their sense of morality and understanding of what is right or wrong. 

In the pre-individual phase, an individual is unaware of their morality and has no concept of what is right or wrong. This stage occurs before an individual develops a sense of morality from their surroundings, such as family and community; rather it lies in a primitive state where there is no knowledge or cognitive thought about it yet. 

The individual phase is when an individual's moral understanding begins to form and solidify over time due to interactions with society around them. This can include things like religion, cultural beliefs or even life experiences; however it is still rooted in an egocentric way as the focus remains on one's own morals instead of collective ones. 

The collective-individual phase occurs when an individual's moral views begin to interact with that of larger social structures like law or religious doctrine; they learn more than just what they were taught by family but also by political figures or spiritual leaders as well. At this point moral understanding is beginning to include more than just one's own experience which can allow for more nuanced thought processes on larger societal issues concerning justice and fairness. 

Finally the transindividual phase expands upon previous stages by taking into account more abstract concepts such as globalism and universal values which are not tied down specifically by one particular culture but instead reflect humanity as a whole. This stage requires individuals to move beyond looking at things from either their own perspective alone or simply through one culture lens but instead see how different cultures intersect with each other in various ways that shape our collective worldviews on morality today.

In Simondon's model, the pre-individual phase is one of potential and potentiality. With regard to free speech in the US, this phase would be when an individual harbours a desire to express themselves and their ideas but does not yet have the capability or opportunity to do so. This could involve both an unawareness or lack of knowledge about how to properly channel their ideas into speech, as well as a lack of access to forums where they can engage in discourse with others. 

The individual phase is characterized by articulation and actualization of the individual’s desires. In terms of free speech, this would be when an individual expresses their thoughts and opinions through verbal or written language. This could involve writing articles for publication, giving speeches in public forums, engaging in conversations with others on social media platforms, or simply telling someone what they think. 

The collective-individual phase takes into account the context within which these individual expressions take place. In terms of free speech in the US, this would involve looking at how an individual's argument is received by society at large and how it impacts discourse within a given cultural context. This could involve tracking public opinion on various issues related to free speech through polls or surveys; examining legal rulings that impact individuals’ ability to freely express themselves; assessing economic factors that affect people's ability to participate in debates like access to technology; and taking into account existing power dynamics between certain populations (such as those based on race or class) that shape people's access to communication resources. 

Finally, the transindividual stage brings together all of these levels - from pre-individual potentiality all the way up to collective-individual contextualization - and looks at them holistically in order for new forms of knowledge production and synthesis about a particular subject matter (in this case free speech). In essence it looks at how individuals are able to use language itself – not just their own words – but also others’ words combined with empirical evidence from both qualitative and quantitative sources –to create something new altogether: one single universal idea about how people should interact with each other linguistically across all contexts for a variety of purposes beyond merely communication such as liberation from oppression or affirmation for marginalized populations .

Simondon's notion of phases of being proposes that all entities, from atoms to social institutions, have four stages - pre-individual, individual, collective-individual and transindividual. In psychology, the pre-individual phase can be thought of as the genetic coding or biological predispositions we are born with. The individual stage is the development of our personality through experience and learning; this is where our values and beliefs are formed. The collective-individual phase is when our ideas and behaviours start to reflect those around us; this is where cultural influences begin to shape who we become. Lastly, the transindividual phase is when we reach a level of self-actualization or mastery where our identity transcends any one culture or society- it is a state in which we become more than ourselves.


In psychology, Simondon’s four phases of being can be applied to the development of an individual. The pre-individual phase is where the person exists in potential: they have not yet come into contact with the world around them, nor do they have any personal identity or characteristics that set them apart as an independent being. In the individual stage, this individual comes into contact with their environment and begins to develop a sense of self and individuality. This is where identity starts to develop and interpersonal relationships are established. The collective-individual phase occurs when the individual begins to explore their relationship with others and a larger societal context within which they exist. They explore their place within a group, such as a family or peer group, while still maintaining distinct individuality within that collective unit. Finally, the transindividual phase is when an individual has achieved a higher level of consciousness through which they can transcend selfish desires and societal pressures; instead developing more abstract thoughts about how individuals interact with one another on larger scales such as in societies or cultures.

Simondon's notion of phases of being provides a framework for understanding how entities transform over time. In the case of the scientific method, it can be seen as transitioning from a pre-individual state, to an individual state, to a collective-individual state and finally to a transindividual state. 

In its pre-individual state, the scientific method consists of knowledge and practices that were established over centuries by various philosophers, scientists and others. At this point, there was no explicit “scientific method” as such; instead it was a collection of ideas about how best to conduct experiments and create theories. 

In its individual phase, these ideas were codified into formal procedures that formed the basis for what we now recognize as the modern scientific method. This version of the scientific method focused on observation and experimentation in order to test hypotheses and form conclusions. This version became widely adopted by scientists around the world in their research endeavors. 

In its collective-individual phase, the scientific method began to become institutionalized in academia through different organizations such as universities or journals dedicated specifically to publishing research findings within certain fields or topics. This institutionalization allowed for greater collaboration within those fields or topics, enabling further exploration into areas that had not previously been explored using shared resources and data sets from various sources.  

Finally, in its transindividual phase, science has become increasingly globalized with researchers from all corners of the world working together on projects with each other regardless of geographic boundaries or language barriers. It has also become increasingly accessible through modern technologies such as open access databases which allow anyone with internet access to access published research findings without any prior expertise in those subjects themselves - thus enabling continued growth in knowledge even beyond what is currently known by current experts.

Simondon's notion of phases of being suggests that all entities, from the most basic parts of matter up to the most complex social systems, have four basic stages.  In the case of chemistry, these four stages can be expressed as: 

1. Pre-Individual: This is the stage at which individual atoms exist in their simplest form and are not yet combined with other atoms to create more complex molecules.  At this stage, individual atoms are in a state of dynamic equilibrium as they search for partner atoms to form chemical bonds. 

2. Individual: This is the stage at which individual atoms come together to form a single molecule or compound.  At this stage, each atom is bound together by strong covalent or ionic bonds and can no longer exist by itself until those bonds are broken apart again.  

3. Collective-Individual: This is the stage at which two or more molecules interact with each other to form a larger system such as a reaction mixture or phase diagram. At this stage, different molecules interact in ways that create emergent properties that were not present in either single molecule alone; for example, when two reactants combine they may produce energy in the form of heat and/or light (in an exothermic reaction) or absorb energy from their surroundings (in an endothermic reaction).  

4. Transindividual: This is the final phase of being for any entity where it no longer exists as an independent entity but rather has become part of something larger such as an environment or an ecosystem where its properties and behavior interact with its surroundings in ways that create patterns and structures on a much broader scale than were present before its emergence into existence (e.g., Earth's atmosphere).

In quantum mechanics, the four phases of being proposed by Simondon can be seen as representing the different states or configurations of a quantum system. The pre-individual phase would refer to a state of potentiality, when the system is undetermined and thus has multiple possible configurations. As the system moves through its individual phase, it crystallizes into a single state. This state can then be grouped with other individual states to form collective-individual states: superpositions of different configurations tuned to specific conditions. Finally, in its transindividual phase, the system transcends individual and collective boundaries and enters into a dynamic equilibrium that fully captures all of its possible configurations—it is in this stage that we see phenomena such as quantum entanglement and wave-particle duality.

**Expand on this using capitalism as an example.** 

Simondon's notion of phases of being suggests that all entities, from atoms to social institutions, go through four stages. In the case of capitalism as an example, these phases could be articulated as follows: 

1. Pre-individual phase: This stage marks the pre-existence of capitalism. The preconditions for its emergence are found in ancient Greek philosophy, the Renaissance and later Enlightenment periods in Europe, which all laid the groundwork for the development of capitalism. 

2. Individual phase: In this stage, capitalist economic practices come into their own; individual entrepreneurs and capitalists take risks in pursuit of profit and accumulate capital. The individual is at the center here; they are motivated by self-interest and aim to maximize their profits. 

3. Collective-individual phase: Here capitalism becomes a shared experience between individuals whose interactions shape it as a collective entity. These interactions are governed by certain rules and laws that regulate economic activity and serve to prevent market collapse or other financial disasters that could affect multiple individuals at once. 

4. Transindividual phase: At this last stage, capitalism has become a system transcending any single individual or nation-state - it is a global system operating with its own logic and powerful networks that govern economic processes from above on a global scale (e.g., international trade agreements). This transnational logic shapes both national and international economies alike in an ongoing fashion - new forms of capital are continually created as old ones crumble away or become more complex over time; meanwhile new participants enter into (or leave) the market with each passing day driven by their individual socio-economic interests conjoined together into one vast system we call 'capitalism'.

**Application to human emotion:**

The pre-individual phase of the human emotion refers to the potential for emotion to exist prior to any particular expression. It is an undifferentiated energy that lies at the foundation of all aspects of emotional life. For example, even before a newborn baby is able to produce a facial expression or vocalization that can be identified as a specific emotion, they have some primitive capacity for emotional states. 

The individual phase of the human emotion relates to an emotionally charged experience that is unique and distinct from any other individual’s experience. Here, emotions are experienced through direct engagement with a stimulus or situation in one’s environment and directly impact our thoughts, behaviours and actions. For example, when someone experiences joy upon witnessing someone else’s success, this joy produces an individual response distinct from how any other person might respond in this situation. 

The collective-individual phase refers to how emotions are socially shared and expressed within a group or in society at large. It also involves cultural norms regarding which emotions are tolerated or expected in certain contexts as opposed to others. Here we can think about shared expressions of emotions such as applause after a performance or sports match or collective mourning during times of tragedy. 

Finally, the transindividual phase brings together the collective and the individual; it reflects how various individuals’ experiences with emotion come together into something larger than themselves – something which ‘exists beyond’ them but which they help bring into being through their own personal experience with emotion over time. We can think here about how expressing strong emotions around certain events can bring people together in shared values, interests and purpose - perhaps even leading individuals to commit acts of heroism or bravery due to their intense emotional state at that moment in time.

**Application using trees as an example:**

Simondon's notion of phases of being suggests that all entities, from atoms to social institutions, pass through four distinct stages. These stages are pre-individual, individual, collective-individual, and transindividual. When using trees as an example of this concept, each stage can be described in terms of the tree’s life cycle. 

The pre-individual stage is when a tree is still a part of the larger whole; it has yet to emerge as an individual entity. This stage could be likened to the tree’s seed state or sapling growth before it begins to differentiate itself from other trees and its surrounding environment. 

The individual stage is when the tree matures and becomes distinct from its previous form. During this stage, the tree becomes more self-contained and gains characteristics that are unique to it compared with other trees in its species or even other plants in general. It also develops an increased ability to interact with its environment more effectively, such as reaching out for sunlight or forming relationships with other organisms through symbiosis or competition. 

The collective-individual stage occurs when multiple trees become linked together into a larger whole rather than remaining separate entities. This could include different species growing together as a forest ecosystem or even one species growing together as part of one larger organism (such as a banyan tree). In these cases, each individual tree is still distinct but has become intertwined in ways that benefit both itself and those around it through mutual exchanges of energy, nutrients and information - either at the scale of forest dynamics (e.g., pollination) or at smaller scales such as within single species populations (e.g., sharing resources like water). 

The final phase is transindividuality where the focus shifts away from discrete individuals towards looking at how these beings exist within broader networks/structures beyond just their physical presence – for example how humans interact with trees in cultural/spiritual contexts or how their diversity contributes towards overall ecosystem functioning across spatial scales and timescales much longer than any single organism might experience in its lifetime (this could include how forests regulate air quality over multiple generations). In this phase, boundaries between the self and environment lose their distinctness – allowing us to perceive things such as forests not simply as collections of individuals but rather dynamic living systems that are continually changing due to external influences yet remain interconnected at all times regardless of whether they’re near each other or far apart geographically.




The pre-individual phase is the earliest phase and it refers to that which is not individualized or differentiated from its environment. In relation to the human individual, this would refer to early pre-natal development when the fetus is still part of its mother’s body.

The individual phase is when a distinct entity emerges from its environment and begins to exist as an independent being. Birth marks this stage for the human individual, as a baby begins to interact with and differentiate itself from its environment. 

The collective-individual stage refers to how an entity interacts with and is shaped by other entities within its sphere of influence. This would include things like family, peers and broader society in which an individual resides in, as these aspects all contribute to shaping one’s identity, values and behavior. 

Finally, transindividuality is when an entity transcends the boundaries between itself and other entities within its sphere of influence. This could refer to things like spiritual growth or self-actualization where individuals attain a higher level of consciousness by considering all aspects of their being - physical, mental, emotional - so they can become more unified with themselves and their environment .


General Expansion:
Simondon’s notion of phases of being proposes a dynamic model for understanding the formation and evolution of entities, from atoms to social institutions. 

The first stage is pre-individual, which refers to the potentiality of the entity before it has been formed into an individual. In this stage the entity has not taken a particular form and is composed of individuating elements that are in a state of flux. 

The second stage is individual, which describes the process through which an entity takes its particular form and becomes structured internally by differentiating itself from its environment. This process can be seen both at the micro-scale (e.g. in atoms) and at macro-scale (e.g. in social structures). 

The third stage is collective-individual, which refers to entities that are composed not only of individual elements but also collective elements that interact with each other to create something more than just individuals (such as cells or societies). 

Finally, the fourth stage Simondon refers to as transindividual, which describes entities that have moved beyond their individual parts and evolved into something larger than themselves (such as ecosystems or global networks). This phase renders obsolete our traditional understanding of what constitutes an “individual” - as it encompasses multiple individuals interacting dynamically with each other as part of a larger whole. 

Simondon's Notion of Phases of Being 

Pre-Individual Phase: 
• Pre-individual entities exist before the emergence of the individual, such as individual components of matter like atoms and molecules. 
 
Individual Phase: 
• Individual entities are formed by the combination of pre-individual elements and undergo a process called individuation that allows them to be distinguished from other entities.  
 
Collective-Individual Phase: 
• Collective-individual entities are composed of multiple distinct individuals that function in synergy, such as social institutions and organizations. 
  
Transindividual Phase: 
• Transindividual entities are those that transcend the boundaries between individuals, such as shared cultural values and collective memories.

In the pre-individual phase of being, what would be an example with atoms?

An example of atoms in the pre-individual phase would be atomic clustering. This involves molecules or small collections of atoms that interact and form together, gathering due to their mutual attraction to each other. These clusters often form the basis for larger chemical and physical structures, such as crystals and materials.

In the individual phase of being, what would be an example with atoms?

An example of atoms in the individual phase of being would be atoms coming together to form molecules. As they interact with each other, they may form bonds, repel one another, and even break apart again.

In the collective-individual phase of being, what would be an example with atoms?

An example of atoms in the collective-individual phase would be a lattice structure, such as a crystal. In this case, the individual atoms are organized into a larger collective structure that can act as an entity in and of itself.

In the transindividual phase of being, what would be an example with atoms?

At the transindividual phase of being, atoms can interact with one another and form different molecules. For example, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom can come together to form a water molecule. The atoms interact with each other to form a new molecular entity that has unique properties.
