**What is the Economic Calculation Problem?** The Economic Calculation Problem is an economic theory which states that central planning of the economy is impossible due to the lack of a reliable means of calculating the value of goods and services. It was first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in 1920, who argued that only through private ownership of capital and a free price system can economic calculation take place. This is due to these systems being able to provide rational economic decision-making via price signals, allowing for people to make decisions about production and investment based on accurate information. Without such a system, there would be no way to evaluate different investments or the opportunity cost associated with them. 

**How might Gilbert Simondon analyze Mises' theory of the Economic Calculation Problem?** Simondon would likely analyze Mises’ theory of the Economic Calculation Problem from a broader evolutionary perspective. He would argue that the evolution of economies is an ongoing process and that it is not possible to simply rely on one particular economic system to achieve optimal outcomes. Simondon might argue that evolution in economic systems could be achieved by allowing different economic models to co-exist and interact, and that this could lead to improved economic performance. He might also argue that free price signals and private ownership of capital are essential components for an evolving economy, but that they should not be seen as absolute truths which cannot be challenged, but instead viewed as empirical tools which must be continuously tested and refined in order to remain effective.

**How does Mises define economic calculation?** Ludwig von Mises defined economic calculation as the process of comparing and evaluating the costs, benefits, and risks associated with different economic activities in order to make rational decisions about production and investment. In his view, prices created through a free market system provide accurate information to producers and investors about the relative desirability of different options, allowing them to make informed decisions about their investments. Without this system of calculation, it would be impossible for people to effectively evaluate the costs, benefits, and risks associated with different economic activities. 

**How might Gilbert Simondon analyze Mises' definition of economic calculation?** Gilbert Simondon might analyze Mises' definition of economic calculation by emphasizing the notion of equilibrium in the decision-making process. He might point out that, in order for a free market system to accurately provide price information for effective decision-making, it must remain in dynamic equilibrium. That is to say that, as new information becomes available and new actors enter the market, it is necessary for those participating to adjust their choices accordingly so that an equilibrium can be reached. Simondon would likely argue that this adjustment of choices is just as important as the actual numerical comparison and evaluation of costs, benefits, and risks.

**How does Mises define price signals?** Ludwig von Mises defined price signals as the economic data that is generated through the free market system and is used to compare and evaluate costs, benefits, and risks associated with different economic activities. He believed that this “price signal” provided accurate information to producers and investors about the relative desirability of different options, allowing them to make informed decisions about their investments. The price signals created by a free market system allow a rational actor to determine which resources should be allocated in order to maximize profits or achieve a desired goal. What are some specific examples of this economic data? Examples of economic data used as price signals in a free market system include the prices of inputs and outputs, wages, interest rates, exchange rates, and consumer demand. 

Using Markdown, a table: each ecomic data type as headers and a short description of how a capitalist might consider each type of economic data in regards to his profit motives as values

|Economic Data Type | Description of Capitalist Consideration  | 
|------------------|:-------------:| 
|Inputs and Outputs Prices | The cost of the materials and services necessary as well as the revenue generated by selling products or services.   |
|Wages | Wages are part of costs and should be considered in calculating potential profits. |  
|Interest Rates | Interest rates can indicate potential returns on investments and can be used to determine where to allocate resources. | 
|Exchange Rates  | Exchange rates show relative prices of different currencies and may influence profitability in international markets.   |  
|Consumer Demand  | Consumer demand helps indicate the popularity of products which may influence pricing decisions.    |



| Mises' Economic Data Types | Description| 
| --- | --- | 
| Inputs/Outputs Prices | The cost of raw material required for production and the price that a producer is able to sell a product or service for.| 
| Wages | The amount of compensation that an employer pays to an employee for work performed. | 
| Interest Rates | The rate of return on investment for loans and other financial instruments, such as bonds. | 
| Exchange Rates | The value of one currency in terms of another currency, often used when exchanging goods from different countries. | 
| Consumer Demand | The amount and kind of goods or services desired by the public. This data is usually gathered through surveys, polls, or research studies. |

**How would Gilbert Simondon analyze Mises' argument about this data in terms of his philosophy of information?** Gilbert Simondon would likely argue that Mises' argument of the use of price signals to compare costs and benefits is indicative of a unidirectional flow of information, where information is used to create decision-making processes that are based on the individual’s preferences. He would likely further argue that this type of information transfer fails to take into account changes in the environment or other external factors which could influence decisions made as a result of these price signals. Thus, he would propose a more holistic approach to interpreting data, which takes into account more than just individual preferences and allows for more complex decision-making processes.

Using markdown create a table that lists Simondon's four phases of being and a description of each:

| Phase of Being | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| Pre-individual | Refers to the order of the physical world, prior to the emergence of individuation or a sense of individuality. | 
| Individual    | Refers to an individuated entity and its emergent properties. It is also used interchangeably with “transduction” as it is when two or more individuals interact that transduction occurs. | 
| Transindividual  | Refers to an entity that exists at a level beyond individual, such as an organizational unit or social context. This is where transductive processes can take place and can lead to emergence of new collective entities such as groups and societies. |
| Cosmo-Individual  | Refers to the recognition of a relationship between the individual and cosmic forces, including relationships between different parts of nature and culture. This phase is marked by a deep understanding that all phenomena are connected with one another in ways both tangible and intangible.   |
