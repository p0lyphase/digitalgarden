Why does it seem animals understand our emotional cues, and we can, in turn, respond to their emotional cues? Are our emotions part of us as humans, something intrinsic to our *humanity* or something that is deeper, something that *precedes* our humanity? The acceptance of animals as *emotional beings* seems to point to something that is shared by both animals and humans and is therefore not something unique to either.

Emotion is the non-human in the individuated human being that is transductively structured as "human emotion" within the human subject (psychical individual), and it might be said that emotion reconnects in the collective (and all throughout).

We can say that emotion is non-human because the mechanisms of emotion (psychosomatic) are not rooted in humans as individualized beings. Instead, it is a connection (mediation) between the vital (biological function) and the psychic (wherein we find the subject) and this vital functioning is distributed beyond humans. 

Within a broader field of emotion among living beings with psychic realities, there is an emotional field that is *centered* on human beings, but still has the potential to connect with the emotional fields of other animals. Those animals have the potential to connect with our own emotional fields. The capacity for mutual *knowledge* about the emotional states of other beings is possible because of this shared reality at the emotional level.
