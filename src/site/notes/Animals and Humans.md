Why does it seem animals understand our emotional cues, and we can, in turn, respond to their emotional cues? Are our emotions part of us as humans, something intrinsic to our *humanity* or something that is deeper, something that *precedes* our humanity? The acceptance of animals as *emotional beings* seems to point to something that is shared by both animals and humans and is therefore not something unique to either.

Emotion is the non-human in the individuated human being that is transductively structured as "human emotion" within the human subject (psychical individual), and it might be said that emotion reconnects in the collective (and all throughout).

We can say that emotion is non-human because the mechanisms of emotion (psychosomatic) are not rooted in humans as individualized beings. Instead, it is a connection (mediation) between the vital (biological function) and the psychic (wherein we find the subject) and this vital functioning is distributed beyond humans. 


Within a broader field of emotion among living beings with psychic realities, there is an emotional field that is *centered* on human beings, but still has the potential to connect with the emotional fields of other animals. Those animals have the potential to connect with our own emotional fields. The capacity for mutual *knowledge* about the emotional states of other beings is possible because of this shared reality at the emotional level.

>The ways that humans can connect with other animalsâ€™ emotional fields vary from species to species, and it is possible to do this through physical contact, eye contact, and verbal communication. Additionally, it is possible to connect with the emotional fields of other living beings through visual and auditory cues, as well as through the energetic exchanges between living beings. Such connections can be both soothing and calming to both parties involved.

>In addition to connecting with other animals at an emotional level, humans can also learn about the emotional states of other animals by observing their behaviors. For example, certain body language or vocalizations may indicate a certain emotion in another animal. By taking the time to observe and understand these behaviors, we can gain insight into what the animal is feeling in any given moment. 

>Ultimately, connecting with the emotional fields of other living beings has the potential to help us better understand our own emotions and build stronger relationships with those around us. By learning how to empathize with other living creatures, we can cultivate greater compassion and understanding for ourselves and others.

### Notes

Between a human and an animal are where these non-psychic emotional operations communicate and inform further individuation, the capacity for individuals to know each other.

This presents to me an interesting question as to the relationship between animals and humans.

Instead of emotions arising within each individual and *reaching out blindly* into the world, the emotions themselves greet each other like old friends, having transfered through emotional individuals.

Emotions are expressed in physical and molecular mechanisms, specific protein forms, etc. because emotions are, also, mediations.
