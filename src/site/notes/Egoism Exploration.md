## Egoism

* descriptive egoism
	* "The descriptive (or positive) variant conceives egoism as a _factual_ description of human affairs."
	* "That is, people are motivated by their own interests and desires, and they cannot be described otherwise."
* normative egoism
	* "The normative variant proposes that people should be so motivated, regardless of what presently motivates their behavior."
	* "Altruism is the opposite of egoism."





#### My Notes

The opposition between altruism and egosim is noted.
