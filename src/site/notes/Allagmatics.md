## Notes on Allagmatics

* #### **Theory of operation**
	* universal cybernetics
	* Operation
		* can't be defined apart from structure
		* a convertability from operation to structure
			* and structure to operation
		* effectuates the transformation of one structure into another structure
		* Middle ground between two structures
	* Structure
		* present in the definition of operation
	* Transoperative
		* rapport of an operation to an operation
	* Conversions
		* rapport of an operation to a structure
* #### **Postulate of Equivalence**
	* "an operation is equivalent with an operation or an operation is equivalent with a structure when they each involve a transoperative rapport or a rapport of conversion with a third operation or structure." -  pg 664 [[Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information\|Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information]]
	* *definition*: analogy is a transoperative equivalence.
		* *analogical act*: putting into relation two operations
			* directly or indirectly by way of structures
	* *definition*: modulation and demodulation are equivalences of operation and structure.
		* *modulation* is the transformation of an energy into structure
			* *act of modulation*: putting into relation of the operation and the structure through an active ensemble called the *modulator*.
		* *demodulation* is the transformation of a structure into energy.
		* structure is a signal
* #### **Theory of the Analogical Act**
	* Relating of two operations
	* Plato used it: logical method of inductive discovery
		* paradigmatism
			* transporting an operation of thought
				* first tested on a particular known structure
				* imparted to another particular unknown structure and object of reseach
		*
