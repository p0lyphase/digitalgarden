Argument:

[[Socialism\|Socialism]] and [[communism\|communism]] have a [[collectivist\|collectivist]] ethos and this is bad. [[Individualist\|Individualist]] ethos made [[America\|America]] prosperous.

The Big Axiom: "assumes the fundamental basis on what the human is to be defined is their group identity, specifically their socioeconomic status, more broadly the oppressors versus the oppressed."

"People have many group identities."

Argues he can be considered the oppressed and the oppressor by virtue of him being black and male, respectively.

My Response: There's some confusion here between intersectionalism and socialist theory. Intersectionalist critique of various power structures and how they enmesh within any particular individual is an important topic that should be discussed, but it is unrelated to socialist theory.

For socialists, the question isn't about group identity but people's relationship to production, and specifically, industrial production. We might broadly say that throughout history within class societies, a small group of people controlled the vast majority of production and a vast majority of people controlled very little to none of the process of production.

What does this control mean? For the capitalist, it is the ability to move capital and purchase labor to produce commodities. They can start or acquire a business and they can purchase the capacity to build things that they themselves do not know how to build.

The workers' labor, from their bodies and minds, are property of the capitalists for the hours that the workers do their jobs. While the workers voluntarily enter into these arrangements, two stubborn conditions remain:

1. The capitalists control the conditions and demands of labor within a particular business, their piece of overall commodity production, and if that labor isn't sold by one particular worker, it might very well come from another worker.
	- The workers don't control the conditions and demands of production. They only  control where they sell their labor and the buyer market is dominated by capitalists.
2.  The capitalists are in turn subject to the overall conditions and demands of labor that are socially acceptable for any given industry. There are the "nice bosses" and the "nightmare bosses" but above all, there's the ultimatum from the market, the capacity to profit.
	- The workers are subject to both the individual whims of particular capitalists and subject to the overall conditions of the markets.  


These differences between the capitalists and the workers are not arbitrary. They are subject to the same markets and world of economics, sure, but they are not playing the same game by any stretch. A forest has many paths, the ground dwellers differ from the branch swingers.
