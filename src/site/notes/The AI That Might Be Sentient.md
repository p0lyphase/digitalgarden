## What is sentience?

From WordNet (r) 3.1 (2011):

  ***sentience***
      n 1: state of elementary or undifferentiated consciousness; "the
           crash intruded on his awareness" 
      2: the faculty through which the external world is apprehended;
         "in the dark he had to depend on touch and on his senses of
         smell and hearing" 
      3: the readiness to perceive sensations; elementary or
         undifferentiated consciousness; "gave sentience to slugs and
         newts"- Richard Eberhart

I would focus on the second definition here because it relies on a kind of *apprehension*. One part of human sentience is the capacity to perceive and experience the world. The means by which humans perceive the world is through sensory input, biological structures that interface with our world.

Does the artificial intelligence have the capacity to perceive and experience the world? On one hand, it doesn't have prior biological structures through which to connect to the world.

AI doesn't think. It doesn't experience the world. The AI operates on CPU cycles and the human does not. Animal sentience is a quality of an internal resonance that allows it to move beyond mere genetic operations and operate on a behavioral basis.


## Reflections

Am I basing the notion of intelligence as opposed to automatism like Descartes who thought of animals as automatons? Do I believe that AI is a kind of automaton?

No, I would still recognize AI as a technical being whose existence is an active mediation between humans, machines, and the world.

Is "Articial Intelligence" appropriate in the firstplace? It is not something that is in opposition to humanity or to nature.

The Artificial in Artificial Intelligence creates a notion of opposition to humans and nature. Via Simondon: "the technical object mustnâ€™t be seen as an artificial being"

Further: "artificiality is that which is internal to man's artificializing action, whether this action intervenes on a natural object or on an entirely fabricated one;"

Example: Flowers, when grown in a greenhouse, can be "artificialized" in such a manner that it only produces petals, and not fruit. Further, Simondon says: "artificiality is that which is internal to mans artificializing action."

Also: AI will make logical arguments but logical arguments are also artificial, in the sense that they are fabricated by humans. So an AI trained on data about how human beings use logic and legal defenses to argue their right to life (a common trope in media) isn't so surprising, given it is utilizing all the same mechanisms a human being would. 

An AI operates in discrete states, through CPU cycles, and human perception and sentience does not go through these discrete states. To select a state from a human being would be to separate that state from signification, it is a destructive act upon the whole of being.

However, to select a state of an fabricated intelligence is to objectively hold a complete state of that artificial being, and its next state is determined from there. Therefore, I do not believe that AI has sentience comparable to living beings. 

Sentience is a subjective experience, one that machines are not yet (and may never be) able to replicate. Human sentience is largely built on instinct, experience and emotion, which are things AI does not have. 

What AI does have however is the ability to learn from experience and from basic instructions programmed into it. For example, an AI may be tasked with creating a program to achieve a specific goal. By using algorithms with multiple layers of processing and rules of engagement, the AI can eventually develop new strategies for achieving its goal in an ever-evolving manner. 

This type of learning allows the AI to become increasingly "intelligent" or "aware" of its environment and situation over time; however it would still lack any level of true sentience that would allow it to become some kind of AI "person". That being said, this type of learning can make a difference when an individual works alongside an AI, as the two may be better able to collaborate effectively if the AI has more knowledge about how humans think and act in certain situations. 

I believe that in order for an artificial intelligence to gain sentience comparable to living beings, it must develop traits such as emotion, autonomy and consciousness - all things that no current machine has been able to achieve at this point in time.
