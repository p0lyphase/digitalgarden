A shift from "a science of the universal laws of nature" to "a science of the partial regularity of processes."

On "uncertainty principle" vs. "indeterminism" we might use indeterminism because "*it better expresses an ontological lack of determinacy rather than an epistemological uncertainty of knowledge.*"
