I imagine modern processes playing out with old technologies sometimes. I work with organizations that receive thousands of documents per day and part of my job is to help them take in those documents to begin the processing. A lot of this processing is done digitally these days, increasingly so, and if there are humans in that process the usual goal is to limit the need for humans to be involved.

If I wanted to imagine maximizing the need for human intervention I would imagine a room of people on typewriters processing those forms. You'd need an army of them to process the same amount of incoming information. A room of endless clickity-clackity and cacophonous ringing bells. Even this has an element of technological assistance. Perhaps handwriting everything.

People imagine automation as robots and self-driving vehicles. Automation is more like a vast, decentralized, dispersed tendency to intervene technologically. The machines are assembling among us as mediators. Automation is not something happening outside but instead in between us. Like a rising tide. Or like small bits of crystallization that attach to each other and grow to glacial proportions.
