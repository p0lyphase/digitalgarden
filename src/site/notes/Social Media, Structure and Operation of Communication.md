# Notes on Social Media, Structure, and Operation of Communication

1. The structure of communication, through various associated milieus (physical, social, collective), will impact the kinds of emotive and affective preindividual tensions that mediate through individuals and rejoin in collective individuation.
	1.  Example 1: Whistle language from the mountains of La Gomera, **Silbo Gomero**.
		1. Structure:
			1. Whistle register language
				1. 1,000 - 4,000 hertz
			2. It requires a lot of dexterity and precision, It is a *technique*
				1. "The physical precision comes in the skill of the whistler being able to vary the frequencies at different speeds and to start and stop the production of the sound waves." - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbo_Gomero#Features)
				2. "Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips, and hands of the users"
			3. Is a kind of *translation layer* on top of another language (Silbo Gomero is a type of whistled Spanish). It has a specific whistle tones for different consonants and vowels.
		2. Associated Milieus
			1. Physical - Individual - Technical
				1. Mountains and forested areas dampen the travel of languages at lower vocal registers. The utilization of the whistle technique produces a sound at frequencies that [travel far and are loud](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-phonetic-association/article/abs/typology-and-acoustic-strategies-of-whistled-languages-phonetic-comparison-and-perceptual-cues-of-whistled-vowels/03100623102D31723CA6BE881E765958), able to penetrate through ambient noise.
			2. Technical â€“ Individual - Physical
				1. The operation of the technique in turn propagates a structure through the air, the *sound waves*, which due to the high pitch and tight structure, are suitable for the environment.
			3. Social - Physical
				1. Shepherding was common in the region where there were volcanic mountains. So coordination and assistance, communication, needs to travel far and be intelligible.
