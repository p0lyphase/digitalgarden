## Gilbert Simondon

>[!NOTE] Gilbert Simondon was a French philosopher that was contemporary with Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and others during that time period.

His philosophy focuses on individuation and he makes arguments against the two dominant ways of thinking of *being*. These are *hylomorphism* and *substantialism*.

>[!NOTE] Hylomorphism is a concept that says that being is a combination of form and substance.

>[!NOTE] Substantialism is a concept that says that being is made up of one substance, reducible to some irreducible kind of matter, for example, atoms.
