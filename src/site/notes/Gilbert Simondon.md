## Gilbert Simondon

>[!NOTE] Brief Bio
>Gilbert Simondon was a French philosopher that was contemporary with Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and others during that time period.

His philosophy focuses on individuation and he makes arguments against the two dominant ways of thinking of *being*. These are *hylomorphism* and *substantialism*.

>[!NOTE] Hylomorphism
>Hylomorphism is a concept that says that being is a combination of form and substance.

>[!NOTE] Substantialism
>Substantialism is a concept that says that being is made up of one substance, reducible to some irreducible kind of matter, for example, atoms.

## Quotes

>To propose a conception of individuation as the genesis of an individu-
ated being that is not the first element of the being is to be forced to indicate
the meaning of the consequences that such a conception must have for the
entirety of philosophical thought.
- Gilbert Simondon - "Individuation in Light of Notions of Form and Information" - pg 361
