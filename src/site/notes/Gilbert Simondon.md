## Gilbert Simondon

>[!NOTE] Brief Bio
>Gilbert Simondon was a French philosopher that was contemporary with Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and others during that time period.

His philosophy focuses on individuation and he makes arguments against the two dominant ways of thinking of *being*. These are *hylomorphism* and *substantialism*.

>[!NOTE] Hylomorphism
>Hylomorphism is a concept that says that being is a combination of form and substance.

>[!NOTE] Substantialism
>Substantialism is a concept that says that being is made up of one substance, reducible to some irreducible kind of matter, for example, atoms.

## Quotes

>To propose a conception of individuation as the genesis of an individuated being that is not the first element of the being is to be forced to indicate the meaning of the consequences that such a conception must have for the entirety of philosophical thought.

>However, prior to any exercise of critical thought concerning the conditions of judgment and the conditions of knowledge, it would be necessary to respond to this question: what is relation? What is implied in such a theory of knowledge is a certain conception of relation, and in particular a certain conception of the individuality of terms as anterior to relation.

>A theory of individuation must develop into a theory of sensation, perception, affection, and emotion. It must make psychology and logic coincide, the mutual separation of which indicates a double inadequacy to the studied object rather than a separation of points of view. *The theory of individuation must be first with respect to the other critical and ontological, deductive studies.*
