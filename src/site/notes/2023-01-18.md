### Thinking about Self-Ownership

When it comes to the question of self-ownership, I can agree that people do own their bodily autonomy and are responsible and accountable for their actions. However, I would not center self-ownership as the starting point for determining optimal methods of social organization, I do not think it stands on firm enough grounds to do so.

For one, the primary conditions of individual actualization are not based upon the individual, but in the collective, and the position of the individual is of mediation. Hunger is a biological indicator, for example, that the individual recognizes and then must mediate that through action, or an operation. The individual relates to an already structured human-technological milieu through which hunger can be satiated.

*Second, that which the human mediates from their vital (or biological-physical) existence is not exclusively human, but are biological structures and operations that are prior to one's humanity, mediated through a human individual body as understood by a human subject embedded in a human collective. While it is a species-body that performs biological functions, the biological functions exist prior to and simultaneous with species-body reality.*

##### AI Rewrite:
>*Human beings are not only defined by their humanity, but also by their biological and physical existence. The way that humans experience the world and their own bodies is not unique to humans, but is also shaped by the biological structures and processes that exist before and alongside human existence. This means that the human experience is not solely determined by human consciousness or culture, but is also influenced by the natural processes and structures that exist in the world.*

When we talk about self-ownership, we are talking about a narrow band of human reality centered on an impoverished notion of the individual in isolation from its associated milieu proper, and when considering the whole of being, pre-individual, individual, and transindividual, we'll find better methods of determining adequate social organization according to a wider domain of reality.

>Rothbard stated the self-ownership axiom in this way: "...the basic axiom of libertarian political theory holds that every man is a self-owner, having absolute jurisdiction over his own body. In effect, this means that no one else may justly invade, or aggress against, another's person."

>These several wordings amount to the same thing. To have self-ownership is to be able to make one's own choices in all spheres of one's life. Self-ownership amounts to an undiluted right to one's life and the liberty to pursue one's happiness.

I would argue that the concept of an "undiluted right" is one based upon the notion of an individual in an inert or unstructured world that requires human will to shape it. In reality, the world that an individual finds himself in is an already structured world, and they can only mediate between their desire to pursue happiness and the means by which that society determines what is understood as a happy life. The social structure of the world is not arbitrary, but it is also not permanent, instead it is metastable, adaptive and resistant to state changes (as in thermodynamic sense).

As far as the question of aggression or initiation of force, this is a topic that is controversial within the libertarian community and is not one that I feel is necessary to address deeply. I think the definition is so vague it becomes something akin to gristle, you can chew on it but you're not getting anything more out of it.

What I will say is that non-aggression principle is less of an axiom and more of a dogmatic statement. Of course, infringement of one's autonomy, or having violence inflincted upon oneself, and I view it as immoral on the grounds that it disconnects relation, and it impoverishes more than the individual, but those to whom the individual in connected to, or could be connected to.

The individual is valuable, it is where potential resides, with the capacity for creativity and invention. It is the capacity to amplify oneself
