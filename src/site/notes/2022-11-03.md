Nothing productive to report at the moment. Just trying out this [[digital garden\|digital garden]] plugin to see how I like it for generating sites.

I got banned from TikTok LIVE last night because people didn't like me talking about climate change and the "appeal process" determined I violated some kind of misinformation rule.

I was talking about biological species impacting the planetary atmosphere in the past (The Great Oxygenation Event for example) and how I don't find it farfetched that the human species also has an impact on the atmospheric composition.
