### Before Kant:

Freedom to
  get educated
Freedom from
  Stealing

Freedom to: "self legislate"

### Kant:

* Two forms of causality:
	* Nature
		* non-agent
		* Law of nature, something that necessitates causality
	* Will
		* Agent
		* a causes b

There are laws that apply to agency
Autonomy: legislate a law to oneself, moral laws

How does Kant know this stuff?
  Welp, can't be mpircally known...
    Pre-condition to be moral.

Ought and Should -> "Means you can" for Kant
