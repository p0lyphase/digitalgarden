>"Value represents the symbol of the most perfect integration possible, i.e. the unlimited complementarity between the individual being and other individual beings. Value supposes that there is a way to make all realities complementary, and the simplest way is obviously to suppose that everything that exists is integrated into a universal will; a divine finality, the universalization of the principle of sufficient reason, supposes and halts this search for value; this finality seeks to compensate the inadequation among every living being with a dissymmetry accepted once and for all between created beings and the creator being."

### Notes

"Value represents the symbol" - An appearence? A stand-in? An aspiration?

"most perfect integration possible" - An optimum solution to problems? 

"unlimited complementarity between the individual being and other individual beings" - Value being denoted as complementarity. Here, the "unlimited" is perhaps a hint to something better to denote value?

"Value supposes that there is a way to make all realities complementary" - A universalizable approach?

"the simplest way is obviously to suppose that everything that exists is integrated into a universal will" - Like God?

"a divine finality, the universalization of the principle of sufficient reason, supposes and halts this search for value"

>[!NOTE] Principle of Sufficient Reason?
>-   (1) For every fact _F_, there must be a sufficient reason why _F_ is the case.
>-   (2) For every _x_, there is a _y_ such that _y_ is the sufficient reason for x (formally: ∀x∃yRyx \[where “Rxy” denotes the binary relation of providing a sufficient reason\]).

>In all these cases, value is the action due to which there can be complementarity. - pg 402

### Three Types of Possible Values
1. Relative Values
	1. "We can deem values relative when they express the appearance of a complementary condition" - pg 402
		1. "this value is linked to the very thing that constitutes this condition, but it nevertheless does not reside in this thing; we can consider that the value is attached to this thing without however being inherent in it"
			1. "value of the remedy that cures or of the nourishment that allows us to live."
2. Absolute Value
	1. "third type of value is the value that makes relation possible"
		1. "the beginning or initiation of the reaction that makes this activity possible and sustains itself once it has started."
			1. Example: Culture
				1. "set of beginnings of action that are endowed with a rich schematism" - *a technical element*
				2. "culture allows for problems to be resolved, but it does not allow for living or constructing organically" - *it provides structure to action*
				3. "it supposes that the possibility of organic life and technical life is already given"
					1. "but that the complementary possibilities do not correspond to one another and consequently remain sterile"
					2. "creates the system of symbols that allows these possibilities to enter into mutual reaction."
			2.
