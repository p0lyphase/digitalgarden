I've been reading about Marx's subsumption of labor into #capitalism lately from secondary sources and have come across some terms of interest. Just feel like brain dumping this out.

Formal subsumption of labor into capitalism is a process by which a capitalist captures formally artisan or trade-based labor and hires them for a salary. At this point, the labor itself isn't changed, just the relationship to what is produced. To expand production the capitalist could hire more laborers or make them work for more hours. Changes are focused extensively in this manner. Limitations are the division of time and biology.

Real subsumption of labor into capitalism is a process by which a capitalist alters the operation of the production of commodities itself. It becomes an intensive process. Instead of a person that produces something whole to sell the capitalist finds ways incorporate machines into the labor process. In a sense, the production of the commodity is broken down, dissected, and in its deconstructed form, can be refitted with machines that take the place, in part, of the knowledge of how to produce the good. This is the division of labor. Eventually, making a shirt has nothing to do with the knowledge of making a shirt from start to finish, but about the coordination (logistics) of mass supply chains to mass produce shirts. The social interaction with the production of the shirt from labor to consumption is transformed entirely.

So with this I get a few intuitive pulls: that the process of capitalism is carrying humanity with it (as opposed to humanity being the main driving force) and is metamorphosing all social relations to capitalist relations. Through this metamorphosis the terrain upon which social relations may construct also change and become increasingly dependent upon capitalist relations. It's like we're on a ship and it took off and we've lost the ground that was there before.

I read through "[Alien Capital](https://vastabrupt.com/2018/07/11/alien-capital/)" by Primož Krašovec and he elucidated some interesting points about the relationship difference between production and consumption by ordinary people as opposed to be capitalists.

The circuit of the relation between ordinary people and capital is as follows: structural dependency on the access to money → participation in capitalist production → everyday consumption.

From the capitalist’s perspective, the circuit of the relation with capital is therefore: structural dependency on money → managing the process of production according to the imperative of competition → profit, only a small portion of which is intended for the capitalist’s personal consumption (albeit an extremely luxurious one in comparison to personal consumption of regular employees) → reinvesting profit into production.

Though Primož's broader point is that capital is an alien agent in of itself, what struck me was how he pointed out that the consumer is indifferent to how things are produced. The social connection to production for a worker within capitalism is increasingly about what the wages allows for rather than how the commodity is produced. For me, I work in the technical field and it has little to do with the commodities I purchase.

So this points out a pretty major flaw in any approach that tries to use education of the origins and processes of commodity production as a vehicle for change within that process. The commodity appears to people on screens and in aisles. Any theory of change will need to grapple directly with the state of alienated labor humanity finds itself within. I find myself especially skeptical of any kind of argument that concludes to a kind of return to non-alienated labor through localism because I believe the social metamorphosis is not something that can be reversed.
